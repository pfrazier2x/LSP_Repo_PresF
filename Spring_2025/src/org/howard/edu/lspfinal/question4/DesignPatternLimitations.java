     * In some situations, using a design pattern may actually overcomplicate the solution
     * instead of simplifying it. One specific case discussed in class was when a problem
     * is simple and well-contained — for example, reading a configuration file or performing
     * a one-off task — and introducing a pattern like Singleton or Strategy adds extra
     * boilerplate that isn't needed. 
     * 
     * Using patterns in these cases can lead to over-engineering. We talked about how patterns
     * are tools — not rules — and that the best approach is to apply them only when the added
     * structure and flexibility they provide are truly needed.
